        Rick is the youngest member of the Stickman family. Despite his youth, Rick is an
        excellent swordsman and has never lost a single duel. However, he's prone to making
        mistakes and often gets beat up pretty badly. No matter how badly he gets beaten, he
        always comes back for more.
        <br>
        <br>
        Rick wields a sword and shield combo which allows him to block damage and stun enemies.
        He is slower than most of his opponents, so he will tend to take a bit more damage than his
        siblings, but makes up for it in survivability.
