# Stickman's Quest ver. 0.01

### Overview:

Stickman's Quest is a simple rougelike game which is designed to be played quickly. Many aspects of the game are randomized, which makes each playthrough unique. Players will level up a character of their choosing by defeating monsters and acquiring items and skills.

Currently, the game is not designed with mobile devices in mind, however, this will come in the future. Also, the rough MSPaint assets are more for the sake of convenience and will be hopefully be updated in the future.
